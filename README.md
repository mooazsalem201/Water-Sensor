# Water-Sensor
Water Sensor reads water levels from a pool and displays the percentage of emptiness of the pool.
If the water level decreasec the microchip sends a signal to another microchip to activate a motor which will pump water in the pool
The picture posted shows the circuit,but is just a simulation, the circuit must change when being made in real life
